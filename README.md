There are many reasons why you should avoid using Bayanno Hospital Management System Pro 3.0 Nulled 12 or any other nulled script for that matter. Here are some of them:

- **Lack of updates and support:** When you use a nulled script, you will not receive any updates or support from the original developer. This means that if there are any bugs, errors, security issues or compatibility problems with your script, you will not be able to fix them or get help from anyone. You will also miss out on any new features or improvements that the developer might release in the future.
- **Potential malware or viruses:** When you download a nulled script from an unknown source, you have no way of knowing what else is included in the file. There is a high chance that the nulled script might contain malware or viruses that can harm your server, your website or your data. Some nulled scripts might also have backdoors or hidden codes that can allow hackers to access your server or website and steal your information or damage your files.
- **Legal issues and ethical concerns:** When you use a nulled script, you are essentially stealing someone else's work and violating their intellectual property rights. This is not only unethical, but also illegal in many countries. You could face legal actions or penalties from the original developer or the authorities if they find out that you are using a nulled script. You could also lose your reputation and credibility as a professional or a business owner if your customers or partners discover that you are using a nulled script.
